        <h1>Lazy Pizza Pocket</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Since I'm a busy, work-from-home, mom, I tend to need super quick meals to make for my lil kiddo. This is one of them.</p>
        <p>If you're a fan of pizza and grilled cheese, this is definitely for you! AND it only uses <strong>4 ingredients.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong>5 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong>2-6 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Total Time:</strong>7-11 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Serving Size:</strong>1 serving</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices of your choice of bread (crusts cut off)</li>
            <li>1 tsp of your choice of tomato sauce or marinara</li>
            <li>a pinch of your choice of shredded cheese</li>
            <li>3 slices of pepperoni (each slice cut in half)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep 2 slices of bread with tomato sauce. Be sure to spread the sauce a bit in the center but not too far to the edges.</li>
            <li>Add cheese to the center of each bread slice.</li>
            <li>Take 3 half sliced pepperonis and arrange them in the center of each bread slice.</li>
            <li>Top both the bread slices with the other 2 slices of bread. Using a fork, crimp the edges so that they seal.</li>
            <li>Add each sandwich/pizza pocket into the toaster and toast for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with your choice of side (my kiddo likes his with a side of chips and apple slices.)</li>
        </ol>
