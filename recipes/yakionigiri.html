        <h1>Yaki Onigiri</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Don't be fooled, these are NOT jelly filled donuts (thanks localized ver of Pokemon.) Yaki in Japanese means grilled. Onigiri are rice balls. Thus: Grilled Riceballs.</p>
        <p>This is a really easy yet fun take on a very convient Japanese snack. I like to pack these for long trips to the zoo or as just to whip up as a fun afternoon snack for my family.</p>
        <p>This recipe does require you to handle rice with your hands. To avoid a sticky mess, be sure to wet your hands before handling the cooked rice.</p>
        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong>15 - 20 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong>5 - 10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Total Time:</strong>20 - 30 minutes</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooked Rice (preferrably left out to cool so you don't burn your hands)</li>
            <li>Your choice of filling (I typically use salmon flakes mixed with japanese mayo or japanese sour plums</li>
            <li>Furikake (or crushed seaweed and sesame seeds if you don't have any)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prep your onigiri you must have the follower: one plate for the molding area, one plate for the setting area, one plate for your rice.</li>
            <li>
                <p>With wet hands (I also like to salt them but that's up to you), grab a handful or rice and mold it into a ball.</p>
                <p><em>(the trick to making the infamous triangle shape is by using bent hands (fingers bent at the base) and molding the rice to the shape of your hands)</em></p>
                <p>If the concept is too difficult, you can look up tutorials on youtube!</p>
            </li>
            <li>Press the center of the rice ball to make a lil bowl like space. Fill this with your choice of filling.</li>
            <li>Cover the filling with a bit more rice and reform the shape of your onigiri. Repeat these steps until you have your desired amount of onigiri.</li>
            <li>Make your glaze! Combine your soy sauce and sugar in a bowl, adjust to taste.</li>
            <li>Warm up a pan on medium low heat. Once warm, brush your glaze over the face of your onigiri and place it into the pan.</li>
            <li>Grill the onigiri for 1-3 minutes. Glaze the side facing up before flipping and grilling for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat until all of your onigiri have been grilled. Garnish with furikake and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
