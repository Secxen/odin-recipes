        <h1><u>Japanese Curry</u></h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is my typical go to for colder weather! Yields plenty of left overs to last you a week.</p>
        <p>Japanese curry tends to lack the spiciness of typical curries and instead emphasizes its sweetness and savoriness.</p>
        <p>Do keep in mind that this recipe is time consuming and requires good monitoring.</p>
        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong>15 - 30 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong>2 - 3 hours</p>
        <p><strong>Overall Time:</strong>2.5 - 3.5 hours</p>
        <p><strong>Serving Size:</strong>6 - 10 servings</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs of cubed bite size chuck beef roast (or preferred cut of beef)</li>
            <li>3-4 cubed large potatoes</li>
            <li>1 chopped large carrot or 2-3 medium carrots</li>
            <li>1 chopped large brown onion</li>
            <li>As much minced garlic as you'd like</li>
            <li>4-6 Japanese Curry Roux blocks</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated apple</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp worcestershire</li>
            <li>2 - 3 cups of water (depends on how you like your sauce)</li>
            <li>cooked rice (as much as you'd like to serve)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a medium to large dutch oven or stew pot on medium or medium low heat. Add oil. </li>
            <li>Once oil shimmers, add garlic.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Once garlic is fragrent, add your cubed beef and brown each side for 1-3 minutes. DO NOT COOK THROUGH.</p>
                <p>(Cooking in batches might be necessary if your pot is too small.)</p>
             </li>
            <li>Add onions (and beef if you had to do batches) and stir until well coated.</li>
            <li>Add carrots and potatoes, again stir until well coated</li>
            <li>Add water, honey, apple, and worcestershire. Cover pot and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 2-2.5 hours until meat and vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Check on it at the 1 hour mark and 2 hour mark. Stir if needed and check meat tenderness.</li>
            <li>Once meat is at desired tenderness,turn off the heat, use a large spoon and some chopsticks to slowly dissolve the curry roux.</li>
            <li>Once roux has fully disolved, give the curry a stir to fully encorporate the roux.</li>
            <li>Serve with cooked rice.</li>
        </ol>
